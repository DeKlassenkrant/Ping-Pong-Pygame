# Ping-Pong-Pygame
The repository contains a prototype of the Ping-Pong game. It is a multiplayer game.

The game was implemented in Python using the Pygame library. If you dont want the code, go to the dist folder and open main.exe

Player 1 controls the left paddle using the W and S keys, and Player 2 controls the right paddle using the up and down arrow keys.

(dist folder is going to be uploaded once I figure out how to add folders)
